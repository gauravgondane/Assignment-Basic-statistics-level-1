2. The student's scores show consistency with a slight right skew.

### Q13-Q15: Nature of Skewness
- When mean = median: Symmetric distribution
- When mean > median: Positively skewed
- When median > mean: Negatively skewed

### Q16-Q17: Nature of Kurtosis
- Positive kurtosis: Heavier tails and sharper peak than normal distribution
